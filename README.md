## ‚öñAssumptions & Trade-offs

- Assumed authentication is required for creating or managing tickets.  
- Implemented dark mode toggle using Vue Options API for simplicity.  
- Queue system is set to `database` for portability; in production, Redis/SQS would be preferable.  
- Chose polling for ticket updates instead of WebSockets due to time constraints.

---

## What I‚Äôd Do With More Time

- Add role-based access control (admin vs. agent vs. user).  
- Replace polling with WebSockets (Laravel Echo + Pusher/Redis).  
- Add unit and feature tests for tickets and API endpoints.  
- Implement Docker for easier setup across environments.  
- Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI).
